Repository for LAHacks - Zen project: puzzle game

Phase 1 - creating a shape matching puzzle game
The user can use their mouse to move rectangle shapes.
Features to be added: 
* different shapes and more of them (Triangle, Circles, Ovals, etc)
* able to tilt the shape
* starting position of shapes are more natural (like sitting on the bottom)
* (optional) have a outline of a winning state of the game

Kinect-depth library implemented from Daniel Shiffman.

Next goal is to implement processing to handle objects and use designed shapes.
